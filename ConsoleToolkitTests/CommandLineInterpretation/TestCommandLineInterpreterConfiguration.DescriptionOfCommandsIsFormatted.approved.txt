fourth The fourth command is really                         
       complicated with a number of                         
       parameters and also options. This                    
       is the sort of command that needs                    
       lots of text.

                  complicated nonsense                      
                  should be forgotten.                      
       crpyticnum The amount of nonsense                    
                  the user needs to                         
                  forget.

       ignore Use this option to consign                    
              this command to history,

desc   Descriptions can contain embedded                    
       line breaks -->                                      
       <-- like that one. These should                      
       be respected in the formatting.                      
       (This is meant to look a bit odd.                    
       Also, you should be aware that                       
       the deliberate line break is the                     
       only one in this text.)
