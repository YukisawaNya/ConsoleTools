        operations.                                         
desc    Descriptions can contain                            
        embedded line breaks -->                            
        <-- like that one. These should                     
        be respected in the formatting.                     
        (This is meant to look a bit                        
        odd. Also, you should be aware                      
        that the deliberate line break                      
        is the only one in this text.)

fourth  The fourth command is really

        parameters and also options.                        
        This is the sort of command that                    
        needs lots of text.
